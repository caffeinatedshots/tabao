**App Description**

A food delivery web application that leverages on crowd sourcing to bring affordable food options to peoplesâ€™ homes. The traditional food delivery in place now is mainly for small cafes and restaurants and has minimum order amount of approximately $20. For busy individuals who just want a simple meal spending $20 is quite expensive.

With our web application we aim to achieve lowered cost via crowdsourcing. The ideal scenario would be an individual travelling from A to B would conveniently pick up food from around A and deliver it to B, where the requestor would be waiting, for a small fee.

**Platform:** MeteorJS
